At some point I got into the mood to write an OpenGL game in Rust.

I pretty much lost patience at the point that I had to import 3D assets using a C++
library. Since you have to use C wrappers and FFI to make Rust work with C++.

Anyway this project is pretty shitty but maybe someone can use it as a quick reference
if they want to do something similar in Rust.
